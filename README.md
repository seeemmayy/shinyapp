# Shiny App

This app takes in csv from public bucket and creates a 4 page display.

First page is an overview of the different regions for the different main presenting complaints for cats and dogs. The cat and dog page are identical showing each of the species results. The viewer can choose between the different main presenting complaints and region they want to look through and zoom into a specified timescale.

The methodology page will contain the method for the statistical results for the user to read if they would like.
